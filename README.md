Notes For 03/28/2024

Definitions
Computer Gigahertz nano seconds
Increase processor
Difference between a database and spreadsheet
Database breaks large amount of data and sorts it
KeyWord Private can only be manipulated within the class
KeyWord this allows us to distinguish between object and local method
Every object for string needs toString()
If you create a new method to replace the default toSting it is called OverRIDE 
Security Feature JVM
Inhertence
Method Signature 
Overload - you have to use the same signature
Instantiating 
Set Method is called a mutator method tipically changes an objects state
Get Method
Multiple Classes
Enumeration using acronyms make a sort of your own constants
Java collects garbage collection
Static does not require an object and it is a class variable ex video game different players but in same course
Attributes ex hours min sec
Final last time you are using code

Code Quiz
Two dimensional array nested for loop to print array
Print Even or Odd Numbers
Call method that takes in 2 dim array print arrays then 
if number num %2 !=0 print “odd” print a 0

Java goes back to garbage and retrieves 
.this ----> attribute of an object
overload ----> method name but parameters are different
composition ----> objects can be used using different objects another class that supports to build that object
finalized-----> to be reclaimed
Command Line Input--->
Pass by Reference---->

gliffy.com/
Inheritance----> (to not have to repeat all methods/fields) (SECURITY) passed down Make more sub classes that extends the super class, programming to the specific, 
super class does not have access to sub class but sub class has access to super class
program to the specific 

least priveledge---->
polymorpsh--->1 method many forms  
Abstract Class---> interfaces
extended is a keyword to let us know that we are using inheretance
static- class controls it

keyword extend class before is sub the class after is super class
extends from blue print

super---->base plus commissionemployee
override means overrides method in super class
earnings method from super class

make yourself a baseplus commission employee on homework.
3 set of code

last one only turn PayrollSystemTest

Change  a value of a given index of an array after it is created

Inheretence allowing subclass object to only do its job.
Polymorphsm 1 method many forms(programming to the general)

Abstract method(super class)--->method without a body but it dictates the interface(can not create any object from it)
forces class to become abstract no implementation can not build methods

Concrete classes are not abstract which means you can build an object from it
extends---polymorphsm must have inherentence subclasses

ToString()
private attribute can only be acessed in class
protected a subclass can access from a superclass use a pound
subclass must have earnings method
extends

keeps the code;
Execption handling owner data
Concrete Abstract Polymorphism Extend Ingeretence

integrity trustworthy
inheretence writing to the specific
